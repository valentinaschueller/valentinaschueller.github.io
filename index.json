These physical processes can be modeled by coupling the Richards equation for groundwater flow to a shallow water model for rivers or lakes ([Bastian et al., 2012](https://doi-org.ludwig.lub.lu.se/10.1007/978-3-642-25100-9_65)). We analyzed the fully discrete, linearized formulation of this coupling problem, yielding an optimal choice of the relaxation parameter for sequential Dirichlet-Neumann iterations. Here we followed the techniques previously established in [Monge \u0026 Birken, 2018](https://doi-org.ludwig.lub.lu.se/10.1007/s00466-017-1511-3). This analysis is closely linked to parallel Dirichlet-Neumann iterations, which are a special case of parallel-in-time waveform relaxation. Waveform relaxation methods have been extensively studied in continuous or semi-discrete formulations. As we will show in this talk, the fully discrete analysis—corresponding to the actual implementation in a numerical model—can give significantly different results. Our theoretical analysis is supported by numerical results for a fully nonlinear test case using [DUNE](https://dune-project.org/) and [preCICE](https://precice.org/).","tags":["waveform iterations","Strang splitting","energy conservation","order degradation"],"title":"Waveform Relaxation for Coupled Groundwater and Surface Flows","type":"event"},{"authors":["Valentina Schüller"],"categories":[],"content":"In this project, we are analyzing coupling algorithms for the Richards equation coupled to the shallow water equations (SWE). These are nonlinear partial differential equations which can model groundwater and surface flows, respectively. Coupling them yields a model that can simulate effects of water management and flooding on the water table and aquifer.1 Particularly, I am working on a fully discrete and continuous analysis of Dirichlet-Neumann Waveform Relaxation (DNWR) for a linearized, coupled Richards-SWE model. Here I have used methods developed by Monge \u0026amp; Birken, 2018 and Gander, Kwok \u0026amp; Mandal, 2014.\nI have developed a test code for analysis verification. Additionally, I have reworked and extended an implementation of the fully nonlinear model.

However, sticking to standard coupling schemes can easily decrease the achievable convergence order of the numerical solution, specifically with respect to time integration; a phenomenon we call order degradation. To understand these effects (and possible solutions), we want to study specifically the interaction of coupling schemes and time integration methods. In this talk, we present and analyze a simple test case of two masses connected with springs; we use it to isolate the impact of the coupling scheme on the overall accuracy and energy conservation of a partitioned simulation. We show issues arising for combinations of traditionally used coupling schemes and common time integration methods. We demonstrate that these two components interact with each other, which can lead to surprisingly good and bad results. Continuing the analysis, we confirm how Strang splitting and waveform iterations can reduce or even prevent order degradation. Additionally, we analyze their impact on energy conservation. Both Strang splitting and waveform iterations are discussed with respect to their applicability in full-scale multiphysics applications. We finally give an outlook on an extension of the test case to study the convergence of waveform iterations for subcycling and multirate time stepping. This enables us to also cover applications with a multiscale characteristic.","tags":["waveform iterations","Strang splitting","energy conservation","order degradation"],"title":"A Simple Test Case for Error Reduction of Black-Box Coupling Schemes","type":"event"},{"authors":["Valentina Schüller","Benjamin Rodenberg","Benjamin Uekermann","Hans-Joachim Bungartz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1657065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657065600,"objectID":"f2d72cc7a969fcc55bc4caf2cad6c6de","permalink":"https://valentinaschueller.github.io/publication/fsi-paper/","publishdate":"2022-08-10T11:07:51+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fsi-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The most commonly used coupling schemes in partitioned multiphysics simulations suffer from a decrease in the order of convergence, specifically in the time domain; a phenomenon we call order degradation.
